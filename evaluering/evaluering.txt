I read the thesis ``Grid Replicated Storage for the Minimum Intrusion
Grid'' by Jan Lykke Wiberg as part of my evaluate-anothers-thesis
requirement. 

Overall:

The layout and the choice of font for the thesis is pleasing, the
typesetting looks professional. The margins and such makes it easy to
read.

The English is fluid and of high quality. 

The content is presented in a natural order. Alternatives are
presented whenever a choice is made. 

The number of examples and graphs are perhaps a bit on the low side,
but when reading the thesis, they are placed suitably.

In detail: 

The introduction is well structured. It has the necessary content such
as motivation, delineation of the project and an overview.

The related work section has an a categorized overview of the research
into this area, and seems to cover all major areas although at a high level.

There is an analysis of the situation, some criteria were given in
the introduction which are expanded in more detail. A look into the
how the system will actually be used real time is also given. The
analysis is summarized in a list with the most important points.

The high level design of the system is given in section 4. Figures
complements the text.

Section 5 goes into detail with the design, here we have a lot of the
low level choices. 

Section 8 is an evaluation of the design and choices made. It states
the criteria under which the project is evaluated. Contains some good
graphs presenting the data from the experiments. 

Section 9 is future work, it gives plenty for the interested reader to
continue with.


General thoughts:
The thesis seems relatively thorough though not overly ambitious in
regards to making use of advanced techniques.
