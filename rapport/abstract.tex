In this paper we present a design and a working prototype of a regular
expression engine. It is able to match and extract the values of
captured groups. The design splits the process into several
components. Our components are streaming and use constant memory for a
fixed regular expression, with the exception of one non-streaming
component. We also evaluate the results and compare our regular
expression engine with existing\todo{alt: other regular expression} implementations.
